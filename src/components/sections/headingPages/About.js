                <p className="about-subtext">Little Lemon was established in 1995 by Adrian and Mario, two Italian brothers. Observing the absence of Mediterranean cuisine in Chicago despite its diverse culinary scene, they were motivated to introduce the flavors from their Italian hometown to the people of Chicago. Even after almost three decades, the two brothers remain actively involved in managing the Little Lemon restaurant.</p>
